simple fighting game using javascript Canvas

Hello, this is a small 2-players fighting game I made using only vanilla javascript.
I purposfully avoided using any babel/webpack to keep things simple.
The idea for me was to make something quick that can be playable.

Later on, I plan to add more feature to the game and also clean up the code 
*(If i have the time)*

### Features

- 2 players fighting game using Sprites.
- Gravity
- Attack system
- Work in progress...
